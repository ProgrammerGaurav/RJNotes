    <div class="title">Python For Loops </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
        A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a
        string).
        This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as
        found in other object-orientated programming languages.

    <div class="title">Python While Loops </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
        In Python, While Loops is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is
        satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is
        executed. While loop falls under the category of indefinite iteration. Indefinite iteration means that the
        number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance.
