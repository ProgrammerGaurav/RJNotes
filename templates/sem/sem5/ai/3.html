    <div class="title">Tic–Tac–Toe Game using Min-Max Algorithm. </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
        The key to the <b>Minimax algorithm</b> is a back and forth between the two players, where the player whose
        "turn it
        is" desires to pick the move with the maximum score. In turn, the scores for each of the available moves are
        determined by the opposing player deciding which of its available moves has the minimum score.
